# ki-trivia

Jan. 4, 2021

A personal project written in Python that uses Selenium Webdriver to autofill 10 [trivia](https://www.wizard101.com/game/trivia) quizzes from KingsIsle Entertainment.

When the script is run, a new Chrome browser is opened and navigated to the first trivia page. After filling in the 12 answers, it pauses to wait for manual login (because of captcha), then moves on to the next trivia page.

Mostly an exercise in web automation, though this is also something I've wanted to do for a long time.
